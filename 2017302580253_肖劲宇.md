## P22
We can use these two formulas below to calculate

where F=15Gb=15*1024Mb us=30Mbps,d_min=d_i=2Mbps.  
We can get:  
**CS**: 
N\u | 300kbps | 700kbps | 2Mbps  
-|-|-|-
10 | 7680 | 7680 | 7680
100 | 51200 | 51200 | 51200
1000 | 512000 | 512000 | 512000

**p2p**: 
N\u | 300kbps | 700kbps | 2Mbps  
-|-|-|-
10 | 7680 | 7680 | 7680
100 | 25904 | 15616 | 7680
1000 | 47559 | 21525 | 7680

## P23
a.
Suppose that the server sends the F-bit file to the clients in parallel, and the sending rate is u_s/N. at the same time, the client is also downloading the file.
Because u_s/N<=d_min. so clients can download files at u_s/N rate. Time spent is t = F/(u_s/N) = NF/u_s  
b. 
Suppose that the server sends the F-bit file to the clients in parallel. at the same time, the client is also downloading the file at rate d_min.
Because u_s/N>=d_min. so server can send files at d_min rate. Time spent is t = F/d_min.  
c.
from a and b we can get:  
if u_s/N<=d_min then NF/u_s>=F/d_min so t=NF/u_s  
if u_s/N>=d_min then NF/u_s<=F/d_min so t=F/d_min  
combine the two conditions we can get the conclusion:  
Minimum distribution time:
t = max{F/d_min,NF/u_s}

## P24
suppose u = u_1+u_2+...+u_n.  
a.
Assuming that the file is divided into N parts, each part is (u_i/u)F, the server sends n parts of the file to the n clients parallel, and the i-th part is sent to the i-th peer. The ith peer then sends the received file part to the remaining n-1 peers. In the end, all peers will receive the complete files.  
from u_s<=(u_s+u_1+...+u_N)/N we can get (N-1)u_s<=u  
the i-th part send rate is (u_i/u)*u_s, so the total-send-rate=u_s.   
the i-th peer send rate is (N-1)(u_i/u)u_s<=u_i satisfy the condition.  
In this distribution scheme, i-th peer receive file at rate u_s.   
so t=F/u_s  
b.
Assuming that the file is divided into N + 1 parts, the first N parts are sent to each peer, the i-th peer is sent to the remaining n-1 peers after receiving, and the N + 1 part file is sent to each peer. In this way, all servers receive the complete file.
the i-th part send rate is ri = u_i/(N-1) (i<=N)
so the N+1-th pat send rate is r_(N+1) =  (u_s â€“ u/(N-1))/N which guarantee the total rate is u_s and th i-th peer send rate is u_i.
In this distribution scheme, peer i receives bits at rate r_(N+1)+r_i+r_1+...+r_(i-1)+r_(i+1)+..+r_N = (u_s+u)/N.  
Thus each peer receives the file in NF/(us+u).   
c.
from a and b we can get:  
if u_s<=(u_s+u_1+...+u_N)/N then F/u_s>=NF/(us+u)_min so t=F/u_s.  
if u_s>=(u_s+u_1+...+u_N)/N then NF/(us+u)>=F/u_s so t=NF/(us+u).    
combine the two conditions we can get the conclusion:  
Minimum distribution time:
t = max{F/u_s,NF/(us+u)}
